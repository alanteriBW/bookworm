After my first 30 days, while already able to contribute to the Audiences code baseat a small scale, 
I have a list of technologies I need to become more familiar with in order to actually be an asset
to the company. To tackle this in a proactive, hands on way, I want to create a personal project I 
can work on while blocked or done with other tasks, and during Funky Friday sessions. This will allow
me to learn useful technologies used in BrandWatch and become a better developer all around.
